A web application to re-imagine the process of sharing addresses by digital address mapping using geographical coordinates
used to store the Geographical Coordinates of an address and people can find the address of a person using a simple Id and can also open 
the route to the accurate location in Google Maps. It helps to find the accurate address in Asian Countries based on geographical 
cordinates. Usually the address are based on House Number rather than Street names and it would be a difficult task for the google maps
