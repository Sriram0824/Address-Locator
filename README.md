About:

The last time I have been to India I found a problem that Google maps was not able to pick up the address location based on house numbers and all the addresses over there use house numbers instead of street names. So I developed an application where users need to create the account with a unique id and they can store all their addresses by tapping a button and the geographical co-ordinates are stored in the database. Now people who want to go to that personâ€™s location can open this application and can search for their id to view the addresses. Now if they select open route option automatically the route to that location will be opened in the Google maps. As we are using geo coordinates route to the accurate location will be shown. So we can altogether eliminate the use of business cards, we can avoid remembering the address.

Development Process:
So in the development of this application I used JavaScript to pick the location of the user, once he logs in. Now I populated the input text boxes with the coordinates and then using PHP I took the values and stored it in the database using MySQL.
